        <h2>Physical Computing</h2>
        <h4>I have immersed myself in the world of Arduino development, refining my expertise in the Arduino IDE. Through extensive training, I've cultivated a deep understanding of embedded systems and honed my programming skills for microcontrollers. This hands-on experience empowered me to seamlessly translate code into physical applications, allowing me to create intricate interactions between Arduino boards and various electronic components.</h4>
        <br><br>
        <h4>In parallel, my journey involved delving into circuit design, where I mastered the intricacies of creating and prototyping electronic circuits. This knowledge, coupled with my proficiency in troubleshooting and debugging, became instrumental in working on projects that interfaced with sensors, motors, and other essential components. Additionally, I expanded my skill set to encompass the physical construction of computational devices. Over the course of two years, I've become adept at fabricating materials and employing techniques such as 3D modeling and printing to craft robust and visually appealing housings for these devices. This extensive and hands-on experience has afforded me a comprehensive understanding of the Arduino ecosystem and its practical applications in the realm of physical computing.</h4>

        <h2>Work in Music and Audio Engineering</h2>
        <h4>Drawing upon my extensive training and knowledge in music, I have leveraged my skills to collaborate with and support artists in their creative endeavors. Over the years, I've played a crucial role in the recording, mixing, editing, sound scoring, and music production processes for a diverse array of artists. Working closely with over 200 individuals, I've had the privilege of contributing to a wide-ranging repository of musical projects spanning genres such as hip-hop, jazz, rock, contemporary, and more. This multifaceted experience has not only allowed me to refine my technical proficiency but has also enriched my understanding of the nuances inherent in different musical styles.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>In addition to collaborating with fellow artists, I've concurrently pursued my own creative expressions through original music production. This dual role of creator and collaborator has provided me with a unique perspective, enabling me to approach projects with a holistic understanding of the artistic and technical aspects of music. As I continue to immerse myself in the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of music production, my goal is to further contribute to the vibrant and diverse tapestry of musical expression, continually pushing the boundaries of creativity and innovation.</h4>
